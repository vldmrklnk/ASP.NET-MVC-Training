- Create unit tests with MS Unit Testing and Moq frameworks.
- Design and create a simple web application using ASP.NET framework.
- Use Visual Studio IDE for developing .NET applications.


## Training Requirements

* Strong motivation and desire to learn.
* Basic programming languages skills - ability to read and create a simple algorithm.
* Experience in creating simple C# applications.
* English - A2+.

Hi,

Here is my repository and my tasks - https://github.com/<github-account>/<repository>

+ Task 1 - https://github.com/<github-account>/<repository>/blob/master/tasks/task01-vowel-count.cs
+ Task 2 - https://github.com/<github-account>/<repository>/blob/master/tasks/task02-sort-array.cs
+ Task 3 - https://github.com/<github-account>/<repository>/blob/master/tasks/task03-filter.cs
+ Task 4 - https://github.com/<github-account>/<repository>/blob/master/tasks/task04-find-min-max.cs
- Task 5
- Task 6


Thanks,
<Your Full name>
```

If you can't solve a certain task just skip it, but we expect that you will be able to solve at least 4 tasks.

Also, we expect that you will complete all tasks in two days, but don't hesitate to send us your solution even in case that you miss the deadline.


## Tasks

Each task is a console application that has a method template and test cases. You have to implement the method body in the way to make all test cases work.

1. Getting the amount of vowels in a string - [task01-vowel-count.cs](https://github.com/epam-dotnet-lab/aspnet-training/blob/master/tasks/task01-vowel-count.cs).

2. Sorting an array - [task02-sort-array.cs](https://github.com/epam-dotnet-lab/aspnet-training/blob/master/tasks/task02-sort-array.cs).

3. Filtering values in an array - [task03-filter.cs](https://github.com/epam-dotnet-lab/aspnet-training/blob/master/tasks/task03-filter.cs).

4. Finding a min and max values in jagged arrays - [task04-find-min-max.cs](https://github.com/epam-dotnet-lab/aspnet-training/blob/master/tasks/task04-find-min-max.cs).

5. Getting a list of prime numbers in a specified range - [task05-prime-numbers.cs](https://github.com/epam-dotnet-lab/aspnet-training/blob/master/tasks/task05-prime-numbers.cs).

6. Using class and methods modifiers - [task06-modifiers.cs](https://github.com/epam-dotnet-lab/aspnet-training/blob/master/tasks/task06-modifiers.cs).
